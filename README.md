# gtk3_import v0.1.0

### Personal library, [gotk3](https://golang.org/) helpers

##### This is a private library, not intended for distribution.

> Most of my GUI projects use it and are based on the features it offers.
> It is composed of a multitude of functions, structures, methods designed as aids to the development of software using the [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [gotk3](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3) library, many aspects of gotk3 possibilities are covered.

### Gtk3 ressources:

- [GTK3](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/)
- [GDK3](https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/)
- [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/)
- [Pango](https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/)
- [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/documentation/)
- [Gtk Inspector](https://blog.gtk.org/2017/04/05/the-gtk-inspector/), a great helper to show the construction of an underlying gtk3 interface, control and produce CSS code easily and efficiently with instant visual, view / modify object settings and many other features.

*This list is not exhaustive, with some exceptions due to Golang's specifications. These documentations can help understand the implementation of gotk3 with Golang.*
